These pictures will help them know for sure how to return each classroom or space to its original configuration. I'm considering a QR code posted in each classroom that they can zap to get to this page of the website. When they get to the page, there will be 2-4 pictures of each space where they can see how the classroom or space is supposed to look. I am thinking that we use the ""Grid Style With Space"" gallery code from this page (https://demo.goodlayers.com/kingster/gallery/). I will share with you a Google Drive folder of the pictures.

The text for this page will be: Stonehaven is providing the pictures below to help those using our facility to return the spaces back to our normal use configuration. Your help in this regard is much appreciated. Thank you!

Then title each section with the room like ""Mrs. Denny - Second Grade""","","","2022-01-31"

Prior to teaching, Debbie worked as a freelance stained glass artist and taught community art classes at the Buckhead YMCA and Emory University. She also worked as a graphic designer and owned her own advertising and consulting business. Once her sons reached school age, she embarked on the second career of teaching. Debbie served for 19 years as a middle and upper school art teacher at Whitefield Academy. She attended multiple national and state art educators conferences where she taught workshops on encouraging creativity and also on fused glass. Debbie’s goal for her students is that they feel encouraged and inspired to discover and use their God-given creativity in the art classroom and in their lives. In her spare time Debbie loves to paint, sail, jog, hike, bike, and travel with her husband – enjoying God’s creation. Debbie is feeling very blessed to be part of Stonehaven!","","https://drive.google.com/u/2/open?usp=forms_web&id=1bvBXyCrwrZ9IPglMH-Ih3t5wmgHD3d7T",""
