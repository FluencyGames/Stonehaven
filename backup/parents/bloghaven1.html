                <p>
                 The greatest five-word opener in all of literature comes from God's holy word, "In the beginning, God created" (Genesis 1:1). Every year we choose a book of the Bible to focus on for our chapel talks. In our return to the Old Testament, we have decided that "the beginning," the book of Genesis, is the most appropriate theme for this year. The beginning of our journey at our new Lower School campus, the beginning for many new teachers, the beginning for twenty-seven new families, and the beginning of our tenth grade Rhetoric School. The doctrine of Creation, the fact that the eternal God created the world "ex nihilo," demands that God is the source and sustainer of all things. Creation is so important that theologian Herman Bavinck called it, "the starting point of true religion." Theologian Philip Sherrard argued that, "Creation is nothing less than the manifestation of God&rsquo;s hidden Being." Whether the subject is mathematics or art, the Stonehaven classroom is designed to be an environment where our children explore God's creation and consequently learn more about God's "hidden Being." From the very beginning of a child's journey at Stonehaven, we will teach them that "God created." The ultimate goal of a Stonehaven education is to prepare a child to follow God and imitate his character: to see our children become creators themselves. As children leave Stonehaven after the 12th grade, we will have prepared them to be creators. Our vision is that they will become faithful creators of families, creators of businesses, creators of ideas, creators of churches, creators of ministries, and creators of culture. Our goal since 2004 has been to build a school that partners with Christian families by creating an educational institution that brings, "them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord" (Ephesians 6:4). We have never ceased to consider how our school can grow, enhance, and build programs that can better achieve our Christ-centered classical vision. We are excited to invite our many new families to partner with us in these efforts as we labor to build his kingdom in our community.

                 Every year we seek to reform and enhance our school's Christ-centered classical program. The below are three significant "creations" for this coming school year:

                   Morning Meeting
                  </b>
                  - Our school has always met as a student body for chapel on Wednesday mornings. In addition to chapel this year, on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday mornings, all of our students will be gathering together as a corporate body to sing, read Scripture, and pray. The primary goals for morning meeting include our aim to begin every school day well with a spiritual focus, nurturing in our children a habit of prayer and Bible reading, and cultivating a strong unified culture in our student body.

                   Narration
                  </b>
                  - Our Lower School teachers are focused on creating and defining a more formal commitment to the art of narration. Narration is simply &ldquo;telling&rdquo; back a story in one&rsquo;s own words. Charlotte Mason, a 19th century British educator, promoted and formalized narration as an effective pedagogical tool to be used in our schools. Narration will help our children focus intently, understand more fully their lessons, and develop the ability to communicate well.

                  </b>
                  - For those familiar with the three developmental phases of the Trivium, you will know that this year is significant as we launch our 10th grade program. The Rhetoric phase of a classical education, often aligned with 10th through 12th grade, has a particular emphasis on teaching our children the art of oral and written expression. Winsome, persuasive, charisma, articulate, and eloquence are attributes we will nurture in our rhetoric program. Our Upper School teachers will be dedicated to exhibiting these characteristics in their classes as a model to be followed.

                 I often tell the story of the three masons as a way to distinguish the heavenly purpose of classical education. For those unfamiliar, let me provide the more concise version. Many moons ago, three masons were laboring alongside one another to build a church. A person walking by the three men asked each of the masons what they were doing. Without even looking up, the first grumbled, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m laying bricks.&rdquo; The second turned and looked at the passerby to say, &ldquo;I am building a wall.&rdquo; However, the third paused, looked to the sky with a gleam in his eye and said with a smile, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m building a cathedral.&rdquo; What one person considered to be a boring and monotonous, the other viewed as a glorious calling. This summer and every summer, parents are challenged to step up their parenting game. Many of us will hear the dreaded &ldquo;Mom, I&rsquo;m bored!&rdquo; complaint from our children. One of the temptations we face is to believe that one of our job requirements as a parent is to be a director of entertainment. Every year as we enter the summer, I refer to our parents a great article written by the leaders from the now-closed The Heiskell School. This article challenges parents to &ldquo;really focus on the two &ldquo;R&rsquo;s&rdquo;&rdquo; over the summer. What are the two R&rsquo;s? The first &ldquo;R&rdquo; is to require obedience and the second &ldquo;R&rdquo; is to refuse to entertain. The Heiskell School staff found that, &ldquo;When you refuse to entertain your child, you encourage resourcefulness, creativity, and imagination, all wonderful traits that will serve him well at school and later in life.&rdquo; This will require some patient parenting as children fervently complain about the scarcity of fun in their world, &ldquo;No mom, I&rsquo;m serious, there is literally nothing for me to do.&rdquo; It might feel easier to simply pull out an Ipad or put on a movie but this removes a great opportunity. An opportunity to struggle through the boredom and create their own adventure. Is it not a beautiful thing to watch a person capable of entertaining themselves? In the whimsical book
                 <i>
                  Where&rsquo;d you go Bernadette
                 </i>
                 by Maria Semple, a mother admonishes her daughter saying, &ldquo;You are bored. And I&rsquo;m going to let you in on a little secret about life. You think it&rsquo;s boring now? Well, it only gets more boring. The sooner you learn it&rsquo;s on you to make life interesting, the better off you&rsquo;ll be.&rdquo; I imagine that the mason building the cathedral was the child encouraged to find wonder in the mundane and ordinary.

                 In our efforts for academic excellence we must be careful to put our children in what writer and columnist Nathan Heller calls &ldquo;terrariums of excellence.&rdquo; These educational &ldquo;terrariums&rdquo;  discourage children from taking risks because such failures could taint their aspirations for a spotless academic record. In a critique of the elite education at Ivy League schools, author William Deresiewicz lamented that &ldquo;the system manufactures students who are smart and talented and driven, yes, but also anxious, timid, and lost, with little intellectual curiosity and a stunted sense of purpose&hellip; great at what they&rsquo;re doing but with no idea why they&rsquo;re doing it.&rdquo; This is when I am encouraged to be a part of the classical Christian school movement. A movement that is desperately committed to helping children understand the deeper &ldquo;why&rdquo; for school. If the end goal is a particular GPA or acceptance to certain colleges, the pressure for achievement will certainly cause our children to avoid failure at all costs. With an emphasis on a love of learning, we encourage our children at Stonehaven to make academic leaps even when failure is a potential outcome. How can our children thrive in their future if they have not learned to navigate failure? Providing an academic environment where our children can fail with grace and love is an important part of Stonehaven&rsquo;s culture. Heller says, &ldquo;Learning is supposed to be about falling down and getting up again until you do it right.&rdquo; We seek to graduate children whose intellectual curiosity for learning trumps their fear of failure. This does not diminish our desire and expectation for children to complete their assignments with accuracy and excellence. Rather, it elevates a culture that encourages risk taking so that we can nurture virtues like courage and persistence. Winston Churchill says, &ldquo;Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.&rdquo;

                 &ldquo;The question is not, -- how much does the youth know? when he has finished his education -- but how much does he care?&rdquo; This quote comes from the classically revered educator Charlotte Mason. It&rsquo;s short, simple, and so true. During my years at Georgia Tech, it was not rare that at the beginning of each semester my group of friends would sit down at the cafeteria table and ask, &ldquo;Hey, anyone seen Charlie this semester?&rdquo; A week later, someone would learn that our buddy Charlie had flunked out of Georgia Tech. We had lost another friend to the dungeon of academic apathy. Visions of the prison cafeteria in Shawshank Redemption should come to mind! Sunken heads, looking into our food quietly as we remembered the many fun times we had with Charlie (usually memories that didn&rsquo;t include studying). For most of the students that couldn&rsquo;t hack it academically at Georgia Tech, it was not a result of their lack of knowledge. Their SAT scores were certainly better than average and they often possessed strong cognitive abilities. What was lacking was how much they cared for learning. As our children take standardized tests this week, we have a good opportunity to consider the value of this objective measurement tool.  The results do tell us something. But they don&rsquo;t tell us everything. We believe such tests are fundamentally unable to tell the whole story of a child&rsquo;s intellectual abilities. Therefore, it is important that we don&rsquo;t place too much emphasis on standardized testing that would cause our children (or their parents) to disproportionately measure their academic success by the results. For in the end, our success as parents and as a school cannot be measured by an academic test. As Albert Einstein said, &ldquo;Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted.&rdquo;

Through a series of unfortunate events, Franklin betrays his moral aversion to gambling and quickly succumbs to an obsessive addiction to playing slot machines. In true Twilight Zone fashion, it does not end well for Mr. Gibbs. It is hard to believe that slot machines make more money in the United States than baseball, movies, and theme parks combined. What is so addictive about slot machines? Psychologists have found that the human mind is uniquely attracted to what are termed intermittent variable rewards. When the reward for a particular action is randomized, like it is with slot machines, our attraction to the action is significantly increased. This certainly explains my enjoyment of the game of golf. Random is the perfect adjective describing my golf game; once every fifty swings I am rewarded with a great shot. Not knowing when that next shot will come keeps me swinging. In an article by technology ethicist Tristan Harris called

                 , he connects the addictive elements of slot machines to cell phones and social media: &ldquo;But here&rsquo;s the unfortunate truth &mdash; several billion people have a slot machine in their pocket: When we pull our phone out of our pocket, we&rsquo;re playing a slot machine to see what notifications we got. When we pull to refresh our email, we&rsquo;re playing a slot machine to see what new email we got. When we swipe down our finger to scroll the Instagram feed, we&rsquo;re playing a slot machine to see what photo comes next.&rdquo; It is essential that we are aware that the designers of our cell phones and &ldquo;slot machine&rdquo; apps (Google, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, YouTube, etc.) are intentionally sprinkling intermittent variable rewards throughout their products to exploit our psychological weaknesses and those of your children as well. It has been said that, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easier to fool people than to convince them that they&rsquo;ve been fooled.&rdquo; For us as Christian parents and teachers, it is crucial that we are teaching our children how technology is constantly seeking to distract them. These are not harmless distractions, these are distractions keeping us and our children from living faithful lives in service of God and our neighbor. I am convinced that if C.S. Lewis wrote The Screwtape Letters today, he would&rsquo;ve included a long chapter where Screwtape provided his nephew Wormwood with thorough instructions for how social media and technology can be used for the destruction of the Christian&rsquo;s soul.

                 We have been studying the book of Acts during chapel this year with our students. A significant theme in Acts is the remarkable growth of the early church. We are told that "the word of God continued to increase, and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem" (Acts 6:7), "and walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it multiplied" (9:31), "the word of God increased and multiplied" (12:24), "they increased in numbers daily" (16:5), and "the word of the Lord continued to increase and prevail mightily" (19:20). Why did the early church expand so rapidly? In an article considering the cultural decline of Christianity, theologian Russell Moore argues convincingly that the growth of the early church was grounded in its countercultural nature. He says, "The Book of Acts, like the Gospels before it, shows us that the Christianity thrives when it is, as Kierkegaard put it, a sign of contradiction. Only a strange gospel can differentiate itself from the worlds we construct. But the strange, freakish, foolish old gospel is what God uses to save people and to resurrect churches (1 Cor. 1:20-22)." The miraculous news of the gospel is the very reason why Christianity thrived in the first century. A Christian gospel stripped of these essential doctrines (the virgin birth, the resurrection, etc.) is no gospel at all. In its efforts to be relevant and respected by the world, the liberal church rejects the heart and source of its glorious purpose. Moore notes that, "People who don't want Christianity, don't want almost-Christianity. Almost-Christianity looks in the mainline like something from Nelson Rockefeller to Che Guevara at prayer. Almost Christianity, in the Bible Belt, looks like a God-and-Country civil religion that prizes cultural conservatism more than theological fidelity. Either way, a Christianity that reflects its culture, whether that culture is Smith College or NASCAR, only lasts as long as it is useful to its host. That's because it's, at root, idolatry, and people turn from their idols when they stop sending rain." The lie confronted by every generation of Christians is the same as the one asked by the serpent in the garden, "Did God actually say?" (Genesis 3:1). We are training our children in our homes, at church, and at school to respond boldy, "Yes, He did actually say."

                 When our children look back on their childhood, what family traditions, rituals, and celebrations will they remember their parents taking seriously? Will they remember the annual Super Bowl party or the majestic Easter feast? The extravagant birthday parties or the awe-inspiring Christmas candlelight vigil? All are good but should we not be placing more of our heart and soul into traditions centered on the hope of the gospel? We have entered the week preceding Easter and God is giving us another opportunity to celebrate well with our church, family, and friends. In Paul's letter to the church in Corinth he says, "And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain." The resurrection is absolutely central to the Christian's hope. One historian of Christian theology, Jaroslav Pelikan, eloquently says, "If Christ has not risen...nothing else matters. If Christ has risen...nothing else matters." Our faith is grounded in the resurrection of Christ; this is the perspective of Easter we want to impart to our children. The way we do this is by praying and celebrating in a manner that makes an impression on the hearts and souls of our children. We find a great example for how to celebrate in 2 Chronicles 30:21, "And the people of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days with great gladness, and the Levites and the priests praised the Lord day by day, singing with all their might to the Lord." Seven days, great gladness, praising the Lord, day by day, and singing demonstrate that God's people highly revered holy days. The celebration was all consuming. N.T. Wright clarifies the importance of the coming week saying, "Easter is what it is because, together with Jesus' crucifixion, it is the central event of world history, the moment towards which everything was rushing and from which everything emerges new." If we believe this is the central event of world history, then we ought to be busy making it a central focus in our lives and the lives of our children.

                 For sports fans, one of the pleasures of March is the inevitable "madness" of the NCAA Tournament. Every year, we can expect at least a few dramatic upsets that remind us that the "little guy" truly can take down the best of opponents. In the last week, one of the teams that has captured the hearts of the sports world is Loyola University Chicago. After defeating my beloved Yellow Jackets in the first round, they pulled off the unlikely upset of top-seeded Illinois. In his book
                 <i>
                  David and Goliath
                 </i>
                 , author Malcolm Gladwell challenges his readers to learn why underdogs so often defeat their respective giants. Contrary to what we might assume, he estimates that 'Davids' win almost 30% of the time. In the Biblical account of David and Goliath, Gladwell argues that David, recognizing his certain doom in a traditional fight, finds an unconventional strategy to defeat Goliath. After being clothed in the traditional armor, David questioned the conventional wisdom, "I cannot go with these..." (1 Samuel 17:39). He takes off the armor and the rest is history. David refuses to fight on Goliath's terms. Gladwell says, "What the Israelites saw, from high on the ridge, was an intimidating giant. In reality, the very thing that gave the giant his size was also the source of his greatest weakness. There is an important lesson in that for battles with all kinds of giants. The powerful and the strong are not always what they seem." From a pure talent perspective, the Illinois basketball team certainly has a superior team. Like so many underdog teams before them, the Loyola Ramblers trained all year on a particular aspect where they could control their own destiny: their defense. The Ramblers big man Cameron Krutwig said, "It's been a whole season of that, man, that's our defense... We've been working our whole season for this, working our whole season on our defense." To defeat our proverbial giants, Gladwell recommends that we fight unconventionally like David. It is natural for us and our children to notice the many ways in which we can't measure up to our competitors, to other organizations, to our friends, or even our brothers or sisters. Our children might be smaller, less athletic, less intelligent, less attractive, and maybe even a combination of these factors placing them at a potential disadvantage. It is essential that we are teaching our children daily that when weighing innate skill and disciplined effort, "effort can trump ability because relentless effort is in fact something rarer than the ability to engage in some finely tuned act of motor coordination."

                 On a recent trip to Savannah, my wife and I followed our curiosity to take a tour of the American Prohibition Museum. This unveiled to us the fascinating story of the temperance movement in the 19th and 20th centuries. For most, images of the Prohibition era is what comes to mind when they hear the word temperance. I would argue that our culture is in desperate need of resurrecting the more powerful, classical meaning of this important virtue. As Inigo Montoya wisely put it, "You keep using that word, I do not think it means what you think it means." Temperance has an exalted place in moral tradition as one of the four cardinal virtues of classical philosophy and Christian theology. Essentially, temperance is defined as moderation or voluntary self-restraint. Historically, people have viewed the cardinal virtues as behaviors that can be acquired by human effort; or as Aristotle argues, "moral excellence comes about as a result of habit." Many Christian traditions have leveraged liturgical seasons as opportunities to train in themselves and in their children particular virtues like temperance and fortitude. The current religious observance of Lent helps many believers build moral fiber for self-restraint personally and also in the souls of their children. The catechism of the Catholic Church provides a more thorough and helpful definition of temperance as, &ldquo;the moral virtue that moderates the attraction of pleasures and provides balance in the use of created goods. It ensures the will's mastery over instincts and keeps desires within the limits of what is honorable." Whether during Lent or at a time of your own choosing, parents ought to nurture moderation in the earthly passions of our children that often lead them to indulgence. My initial thoughts include video games, social media, phones in general, television, and sweets. The ideal place to begin this effort is by providing strong examples of voluntary self-restraint in our own lives. The self-denial of our own earthly passions will be noticed and even revered by our children. It is upon this position of credibility that we can then expect similar efforts from our sons and daughters. When done well, we are developing balanced spiritual appetites in our children and helping them establish firm control over their desires.
                </p>

                 A particularly memorable character from the temperance movement was the radical and untamed Carrie Nation. So enraged by the debauchery that resulted from the pervasive drunkenness of her times, she would visit local taverns to distribute personally her view of divine justice. Beginning with rocks, and later with a hatchet, Nation terrorized the taverns in her community for their role in the distribution of alcohol. She desired and expected that everyone else adopt her personal conviction that alcohol was sinful in its very essence. In
                 <i>
                  Mere Christianity
                 </i>
                 , C.S. Lewis addresses this error saying, "One of the marks of a certain type of bad man is that he cannot give up a thing himself without wanting every one else to give it up. That is not the Christian way. An individual Christian may see fit to give up all sorts of things for special reasons-marriage, or meat, or beer, or the cinema; but the moment he starts saying the things bad in themselves, or looking down his nose at other people who do use them, he has taken the wrong turning." This "looking down the nose" is often a temptation for those that have chosen a particular temperate path and realized spiritual growth in that effort. It might be the giving up of technology, social media, alcohol, or television. Yet, temperance is also showing moderation in our application of God's word. Where it is clear, let us speak boldly. Where it is silent, may we resist the temptation to erect unbiblical fences.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Our Christian community would greatly benefit from the redemption of the classical temperance movement. Its isolated definition to the question of drink, "helps people to forget that you can be just as intemperate about lots of other things. A man who makes his golf or his motor-bicycle the centre of his life, or a woman who devotes all her thoughts to clothes or bridge or her dog, is being just as 'intemperate' as someone who gets drunk every evening." Why is self-control so important for our children? One of the Bible verses I use often in disciplinary situations comes to mind. "A man without self-control is like a city broken into and left without walls" (Proverbs 25:28). This provides a helpful and vivid picture of the dangers to our children if they don't develop a habit of self-control.

                 After Hurricane Michael ravaged the Gulf Coast in October of 2018, one of the more popular images from the devastation was of a shimmering white house in Mexico Beach. Owned by Russell King and Dr. Lebron Lackey, the house stood undamaged amidst a landscape of destruction. One would have thought a protective bubble had been miraculously placed over the home. The fifth chapter of
                 <i>
                  Great by Choice
                 </i>
                 by Jim Collins explains the idea of productive paranoia. Productive paranoia is maintaining a hypervigilance in good times as well as bad; it is to be well prepared for the inevitable chaos and uncertainty residing in our futures. Built with poured concrete, reinforced by steel cables and rebar; King and Lackey built their "Sand Palace" in good times to withstand the worst of weather conditions. The wisdom in this chapter can be applied to our work, our churches, our families, and our school. When the relational weather is good with our children, how are we as parents reinforcing our love to withstand an uncertain future? Similarly, our school must be vigilant against the dangers that can keep us from staying true to our mission; behaviors like bitterness (Hebrews 12:15), selfishness (James 3:16), and destructive heresies (2 Peter 2:1). Collins tells the story of the 1996 Mt. Everest disaster to illustrate the importance of productive paranoia. He contrasts the crucial decisions made by various climbers on the mountain days before a terrible blizzard took the lives of eight climbers. David Breashears was leading an expedition that was collecting video footage to be used for an IMAX movie. With a healthy dose of productive paranoia, Breashears decided to take his team down the mountain and wait for conditions to improve so they could safely summit at a later date. On his way down, he passed climbing guides Rob Hall and Scott Fischer who made very different decisions with the same information. Their decision to continue climbing towards the summit would cost them their lives. The thesis of Collins' argument is that, "If you come at the world with the practices of building a great enterprise and you apply them with rigor all the time-good times and bad, stable times and unstable-you'll have an enterprise that can pull ahead of others when turbulent times hit."

                 Imagine a world where everyone approached conversations and situations with a commitment to the question, "What can I do for you?" I think of Sam Gamgee and his longing to serve his friend Frodo in his perilous journey to Mordor. Sam says, "Come, Mr. Frodo! I can't carry it for you, but I can carry you." Sam approaches the table of human relationships with a deep-seated desire to serve and love the other with little concern for his own safety and wellbeing. Psychologist Adam Grant has researched extensively the idea of giving and taking. He argues that people can be placed into one of three categories: givers, takers, and matchers. Using a survey of more than 30,000 people, he estimates that a majority of the world (56%) falls into the matchers group. Matchers try, "to keep an even balance of give and take. Quid pro quo. I'll do something for you if you do something for me." I would argue that matching is the default position of our human nature... "you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours." Fearful of being taken advantage of by takers, we are cautious to give too much of ourselves. Yet, the example of Jesus is clearly that of a lavish giver. In Matthew 20:26-28 Jesus says, "But whoever would be great among you must be your servant, and whoever would be first among you must be your slave, even as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." As we raise up our children, our goal is the giving of our lives for others that they might grow up and imitate this same spirit for others (Ephesians 5:1-2). When Frodo is facing the danger of passing through the Black Gate to enter Mordor, the question to Sam of following his friend was now easy. Tolkien says, "He had stuck to his master all the way; that was what he had chiefly come for, and he would still stick to him. His master would not go to Mordor alone." Sam's heart was consumed by one question, "Master, what can I do for you?"

                 One of the counterintuitive findings from Grant's research is that disagreeable people are just as likely to be givers. Grant says disagreeable people are, "gruff and tough on the surface but underneath have other people's best interests at heart." In his book
                 <i>
                  David and Goliath
                 </i>
                 , Malcolm Gladwell demonstrates well how disagreeable people can also be good and generous. He tells the story of doctor Emil Freireich who is recognized as a pioneer in the effective treatment of childhood leukemia. Freireich was temperamental and difficult to work with. In addition, his strong opinions often put him in opposition to the medical establishment. Yet, it was his disagreeable nature which helped him fervently pursue what he believed was a better method of treatment for leukemia. Gladwell says, "innovators need to be disagreeable. By disagreeable, I don&rsquo;t mean obnoxious or unpleasant. I mean that on that fifth dimension of the Big Five personality inventory, 'agreeableness,' they tend to be on the far end of the continuum. They are people willing to take social risks&mdash;to do things that others might disapprove of." This means that we need to be careful to discourage a healthy disagreeableness that might naturally arise in our children. Similarly, we need to nurture in our Stonehaven community of learning a willingness to wrestle with ideas that our contrary to our own. For it is in this tension, that we can be better prepared to do good in this world.

                 If classical music was publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange, I'd venture to guess that few of us would invest in the company. Classical music appears to have a bleak future: a prime target for hedge-fund short sellers. Blockbuster, GameStop, and Classical Music Inc. all marching along on the same path towards obscurity. In his TED talk
                 <em>
                  The Transformative Power of Classical Music
                 </em>
                 , conductor Benjamin Zander hopes to illuminate for his audience their secret love for classical music. He says, "Everybody loves classical music--they just haven't found out about it yet." He tells the story of two shoe salesmen that travel to Africa in the late 19th century to explore the potential for selling shoes. One salesman reported back to the home office, "Situation helpless, they don't wear shoes." A second salesman had a different perspective, "Glorious opportunity! They don't have any shoes yet." Zander's optimism for the future of classical music is motivated by the idea that the natural appetite for beautiful music resides in each of us. He says, "I realized my job was to awaken possibility in other people. And of course, I wanted to know whether I was doing that. How do you find out? You look at their eyes. If their eyes are shining, you know you're doing it." The many shining eyes in the TED audience provide evidence that Zander was doing his job well. He places people into three groups regarding their proclivity to classical music: the few that adore classical music, those who don't mind classical music, and the many that never listen to classical music. In describing the latter category, he says "you might hear it like second-hand smoke at the airport." There are many in the second and third groups that are under the impression that their musical agnosticism is fully attributable to their genetic wiring... "Just the way God made me!" Zander seeks to dismantle this notion and convince us that we simply haven't been awakened to the transcendent virtues of classical music. Personally, I'm no classical music aficionado but I am fully aware that is because I haven't nourished this healthy appetite. Many might conclude that classical Christian education has a similar grim future in our current culture. I would argue that we have a "glorious opportunity" to awaken our community to the rich and vibrant nature of classical education. As we read in the fourth chapter of the gospel of John, "Look, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and see that the fields are white for harvest."

                 I must confess, my favorite class at Stonehaven is Kindergarten. If I'm having a particularly difficult day, the best medicine for my depressed spirit is a visit to this energetic bunch for some encouragement and laughter. This year, I have a little joke with the class where I point to one of the little girls and ask if we have a new student. I tell them the girl looks really familiar and ask her name. They all laugh and exclaim, "That's your daughter silly, it's Ruby!" I respond with bewilderment, "This isn't my daughter." Ruby throws her head back and giggles, "It's me daddy! I'm your daughter!" I am pretty sure I have repeated this farce at least ten times and the hysterical response is just the same as the first time. I can only imagine the look on the faces of our seventh graders if I tried the same buffoonery with them. Mrs. Martin recently reminded me of a quote from G.K. Chesterton where he recognizes this delightful trait in our younger children, "Because children have abounding vitality, because they are in spirit fierce and free, therefore they want things repeated and unchanged. They always say, 'Do it again'; and the grown-up person does it again until he is nearly dead." A good education appreciates the "abounding vitality" in our young children and leverages this spirit towards the acquisition of an abundance of knowledge. At the core of the grammar phase of a classical Christian education is the idea that we must "Do it again"&mdash;with song, rhyme, chant, and drama&mdash;until they have possessed Christian truth as a part of their very identity. We partner with our parents and our churches in this practice of "doing it again" so that they will never know a day that they did not know, love, and serve God. Chesterton continues, "For grown-up people are not strong enough to exult in monotony. But perhaps God is strong enough to exult in monotony. It is possible that God says every morning, 'Do it again' to the sun; and every evening, 'Do it again' to the moon. It may not be automatic necessity that makes all daisies alike; it may be that God makes every daisy separately, but has never got tired of making them. It may be that He has the eternal appetite of infancy; for we have sinned and grown old, and our Father is younger than we."

                 This past Saturday, a group of intrepid Stonehaven volunteers were busy tackling some various work projects around the Upper School campus. I was personally excited to test my skills as a brick mason. As I slowly labored to build a brick column, my mind wandered to a chapter from Booker T. Washington's book
                 <i>
                  Up From Slavery
                 </i>
                 . In the tenth chapter titled, "A Harder Task than making Bricks without Straw," Washington tells the fascinating story of how the students of Tuskegee University literally built their own school campus. In the first twenty years of the school's existence he was able to say, "In this time forty buildings, counting small and large, have been built, and all except four are almost wholly the product of student labour." The students even learned the art of brickmaking to create the very bricks of the buildings. One might wonder, how hard could it be to make bricks? Washington said, &ldquo;In the early days of the school I think my most trying experience was in the matter of brickmaking... I had always supposed that brickmaking was very simple, but I soon found out by bitter experience that it required special skill and knowledge." I resonated with this sentiment after my amateurish efforts in brick masonry. This story in Washington's book illustrates the impressive perseverance and commitment he had towards the building of his school. In their first three attempts to build a kiln for bricks, they failed bitterly. "The failure of this last kiln left me without a single dollar with which to make another experiment." Many teachers advised Washington to abandon the brickmaking venture. Refusing to quit, he traveled to Montgomery to sell a watch in a pawn shop for fifteen dollars. He says, "With the help of the fifteen dollars, rallied our rather demoralized and discouraged forces and began a fourth attempt to make bricks." Finally, a kiln was successfully built and a brickmaking industry was created at the school. What Washington understood was that the work of making bricks had significant benefits beyond the obvious utilitarian value. He says, "The students themselves would be taught to see not only utility in labour, but beauty and dignity; would be taught, in fact, how to lift labour up from mere drudgery and toil, and would learn to love work for its own sake." He provides an eloquent argument for how the manual arts help to achieve goals of a true, good, and beautiful classical education. Let us continue to challenge our children to build and create things with their hands with the aim that they will find "beauty and dignity" in labor and "learn to love work for its own sake."
                </p>
                <p>
                 There are two other insights I want to highlight from Tuskegee&rsquo;s commitment to erect their own buildings. First, it is not surprising to learn that the students valued their school campus in a much more meaningful way than students at other schools. He fondly recalls that, &ldquo;Not a few times, when a new student has been led into the temptation of marring the looks of some building by leadpencil marks or by the cuts of a jack-knife, I have heard an old student remind him: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t do that. That is our building. I helped put it up.&rdquo; This reminds me of a similar, albeit much less significant scene from my house a few weeks ago. My youngest was none too pleased to find out that I had burned the cardboard box she had diligently been working on. What many might have seen as material primed and ready for the burn pile, my daughter saw value in her cardboard creation as it was the result of her hard work and creativity. When our children build things with their own hands, they see and treat the product with much greater respect and honor.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Finally, I was impacted by Washington's gratitude for the humble, challenging conditions the school was forced to overcome in their infancy, "As I look back now over that part of our struggle, I am glad that we had it. I am glad that we endured all those discomforts and inconveniences. I am glad that our students had to dig out the place for their kitchen and dining room. I am glad that our first boarding-place was in that dismal, ill-lighted, and damp basement. Had we started in a fine, attractive, convenient room, I fear we would have 'lost our heads' and become 'stuck up.' It means a great deal, I think to start off on a foundation which one has made for one's self." This is wisdom, to recognize that the struggle contributed to the cultivation of character and helped keep his school community from vanity.

                 So much to appreciate and learn from the life of Booker T. Washington. He was a man full of Christian virtue; perseverance, humility, and gratitude defined his life and legacy. Are these not the very virtues we should be seeking to nurture in our children? "Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds, for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing" (James 1:2-4).

                 On this day in 1960, four young black students took seats at the lunch counter of the F.W. Woolworth Company store in Greensboro, North Carolina. Knowing that the store would refuse to serve black customers, the young men organized this action to protest the segregationist policies so prevalent in their community. One of the four, Joe McNeil said, &ldquo;I did not believe, for one minute, that I was a second class citizen... that I was inferior in any way to whites. I couldn&rsquo;t live the lie. We decided to take a stand.&rdquo;  The response to &ldquo;The Greensboro Four&rdquo; and their now famous sit-in was tremendous. The next day, fifteen more students joined the protest. The third day, 300 had joined and later 1,000 people would rally to the cause. The sit-in movement quickly spread to more than 50 cities across the South. The community targets of the protest diversified to include swimming pools, libraries, parks, beaches, museums, and transportation centers. The severe economic impact of the sit-ins and subsequent boycotts contributed to the desegregation of the lunch counter at the Greensboro Woolworth store on July 25th of the same year. Four black employees were quietly allowed to sit and be served at the store&rsquo;s lunch counter. Several other businesses and public institutions would soon be desegregated under the influence of the protests. The Greensboro sit-ins were a demonstration of courage, self-control, and the power of truth. McNeil said it well, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t live the lie.&rdquo; A classical Christian education is preparing our children to live a life committed to the truth. Even when it invites ridicule and derision. No generation has lived or will ever live in a society where they are not confronted with lies and distortions of the truth. How are we preparing our children to respond to the falsehoods of their time. Dr. Martin Luther King reminds us, &ldquo;The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy."
                </p>
                <p>
                 A powerful lesson was learned on the first day of sit-ins by Franklin McCain, one of the four original protestors. He said that an older white woman in the restaurant approached him. Understandably, he expected to be chastised by the lady. Instead, she said in a calm voice, &ldquo;Boys, I am so proud of you. I only regret that you didn't do this 10 years ago.&rdquo; Certainly many others were harassing the young men but this woman courageously and publicly voiced her support. McCain humbly said, &ldquo;What I learned from that little incident was ... don't you ever, ever stereotype anybody in this life until you at least experience them and have the opportunity to talk to them. I'm even more cognizant of that today &mdash; situations like that &mdash; and I'm always open to people who speak differently, who look differently, and who come from different places.&rdquo; We are to be training our children to be slow to judge and quick to listen. For most of humanity, a rush to judge the intent and purpose of others is our natural inclination. This weakness is present in all of us and does not discriminate by skin color. A Christ-centered classical education seeks to train a child to listen patiently, judge carefully, and extend charity at all costs.

                 One of the ever-present threats to the industrious of our world is that we would begin to make our work the ultimate purpose of our lives. In his excellent book
                 <i>
                  Leisure: The Basis of Culture
                 </i>
                 , Josef Pieper says, "Of course the world of work begins to become ─ threatens to become ─ our only world, to the exclusion of all else. The demands of the working world grow ever more total, grasping ever more completely the whole of human existence." Jesus clearly describes in Luke 19:10 the purpose of his coming to the world, "For the Son of Man came to seek and save the lost." We also see in Luke 4:18, "He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed." Jesus worked hard. To save the lost, his calendar was filled to the brim with exhausting work. Even with the infinite demands on Jesus and his disciples, he understood the importance of rest. "The apostles returned to Jesus and told him all that they had done and taught. And he said to them, 'Come away by yourselves to a desolate place and rest a while.' For many were coming and going, and they had no leisure even to eat" (Mark 6:30-31). For those feeling exhausted, you're certainly in good company. If we are serious about following Jesus, then we are to be a people devoted to cultivating healthy disciplines of rest and contemplation. In addition, we must be training these disciplines into the lives of our children. We often think of this in terms of vacations and retreats. But, we need to be training such times of rest into the daily activities of our children. Psychologist Lea Waters, argues in her article
                 <i>
                  How Goofing Off Helps Kids Learn
                 </i>
                 that, "There's a constructive form of goofing off that is restorative to the brain... Good goofing off happens when the person participating is competent enough at the activity that he or she does not have to focus closely on the process or the techniques. It happens when reading, cooking a familiar recipe, shooting baskets, or simply daydreaming." The value of work and rest can only be fully enjoyed when they are both integrated together and mastered in service to our Creator. Elisabeth Elliot says, "Work is a blessing. God has so arranged the world that work is necessary, and He gives us hands and strength to do it. The enjoyment of leisure would be nothing if we had only leisure. It is the joy of work well done that enables us to enjoy rest, just as it is the experiences of hunger and thirst that make food and drink such pleasures."

                 There is an instructive moment in Martin Luther King Jr.'s
                 <i>
                  Letter from a Birmingham Jail
                 </i>
                 where he makes a surprising confession, "I gradually gained a bit of satisfaction from being considered an extremist." Earlier in his letter, he had reiterated his criticism of certain extremist groups that were "perilously close to advocating violence." With his fervent promotion of nonviolent protests, if anyone could reasonably take offense to such a label, it surely was Dr. King. Yet, he reconsiders the negative connotation of the label and asks his audience to think of other historical figures that could be labeled as extremists. "Was not Jesus an extremist in love, 'Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, pray for them that despitefully use you.' Was not Amos an extremist for justice... Was not Paul an extremist... Was not Martin Luther an extremist... Was not John Bunyan an extremist... Was not Abraham Lincoln an extremist... Was not Thomas Jefferson an extremist..." The argument is clear and persuasive, being an extremist is not the issue but rather the goal and nature of your extremism, "So the question is not whether we will be extremists but what kind of extremists we will be." Seeing his extremism as a righteous pursuit, Dr. King was able to endure perceived failures and persist in his efforts towards justice and equality. As we train up our children, we should encourage and nurture a healthy form of extremism aligned with the gospel. As teachers and parents, may we be committed to equipping our children with a confidence and trust in God's word that they can persevere even when others mock their Christian convictions. Christ provides comforting words, "Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad for your reward is great in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you" (Matthew 5:11-12).

                 In August of 1969, a communal riot called The Battle of Bogside erupted in the town of Derry, Northern Ireland. This violent altercation between Loyalists and Irish nationalists would initiate a 30-year violent struggle now known as the Troubles. Although misleading and unfortunate, the most common adjectives used to define the two opposing forces are Catholic and Protestant. Recently, I read an excellent book called

                  Say Nothing

                 by Patrick Radden Keefe. Keefe brings to light many of the horrific stories that help explain the tragic consequences of sectarian, political violence. For someone with no connection to the conflict, I found it difficult to identify the "good guy" and "bad guy" in the confusing struggle. In the world of fantasy literature, Tolkien, Lewis, and Rowling make it easy to draw the line between good and evil. However, it is not always so easy to draw such distinctions in our own world. More than a few times, my children have asked me who is the good guy in a sporting contest or a national conflict. Keefe describes well the motive for the violence in Ireland, "Outrage is conditioned not by the nature of the atrocity but by the affiliation of the victim and the perpetrator." I did not anticipate that I would be considering the application of the Troubles to our current political environment. Few would disagree that often the outrage we are witnessing in our times is more connected to the victim and the perpetrator and less about the nature of the atrocity. How can we best prepare our children to live in this divisive world? Christian author Ed Stetzer says, "The answer for Christians in the age of outrage is not some silver-bullet study that will give a new piece of knowledge. Rather, it begins with looking at our habits, the things that we love every day through our choices and actions." I would encourage Christians to focus on the cultivation of three habits in our children to confront our society: worship first, fight hard, and use self control.

                <p>
                 One of the attributes glaringly absent from the Troubles of Ireland was honest and fervent Christian devotion. The people most engaged in violence were not a people committed to worship, prayer, and repentance. Although professions of Christian loyalty were not infrequent, true Christian worship was clearly subservient to the greater political cause. What loyalties do our children see as most precious in the lives and actions of their parents and teachers? In their eyes, are we Republicans or Democrats first or more importantly followers of Christ? Where do we place our ultimate trust and hope? This means we need to be a people committed to the gathering of the Christian saints and exalting the name of our sovereign Lord, King Jesus. Do they see us praying more often than protesting? We must encourage our children to shape their political identity on their Christian identity and not the other way around. Do they see us more outraged with our own sin than the sins of others? The fruit of Christian worship is evident to the world in how we repent of our own sin. It should not surprise us to find more conflict as the flame of Christian worship continues to flicker in the wind.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The takeaway from this moment as parents cannot be to discourage our children from fighting for Christian truth. Jesus fought often against the hypocrites (Matthew 21:12-13), Paul waged war against the unbelief of his age (2 Corinthians 10:3-4), and reformer Martin Luther boldly battled against the heresies of his time. And yet, the word fight can be used in a variety of contexts. Martin Luther King Jr. was one of the great fighters of the 20th century. He was a bold fighter but not like the violent fighting of the belligerents in Northern Ireland. We need to train our children to see and call out evil based on the nature of the atrocity and not the color of their jersey. Let us train our children to fight for the true, good, and beautiful.

                <p>
                 Last, the conflicts of our time are often defined by a lack of self control. Of the many words we can use to describe the events of January 7th, self control can't be one of them. We are a culture in desperate need of self-control and this has been made painfully clear over the past twelve months. In Proverbs 29:11 we read, "A fool gives full vent to his spirit, but a wise man quietly holds it back." Many events of the past year have been a full venting of the spirit (lower case s). The virtue of self-control or temperance was so highly regarded in ancient Greece that it was included as one of the four cardinal virtues along with prudence, justice, and fortitude. Aristotle said, "I count him braver who overcomes his desires than him who conquers his enemies; for the hardest victory is over self." The virtue of self-control is not a trendy virtue (like creativity, grit, or tolerance) but I believe it will be an essential trait for our children.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Let us listen to the call of Paul to the church in Ephesus, "Look carefully then how you walk, not as unwise but as wise, making the best use of the time, because the days are evil. Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is."

                 I remember hearing the word catechism when I was about 19 and thinking, "What in the world is a catechism?" Even though I had been raised in the church, this word was foreign to me. For all I knew, it could've been referring to a dire disease destroying our feline population. The idea of training Christian children with an archaic set of formalized questions and answers likely seemed too restrictive to our modern minds. However it happened, catechisms have been relegated to the trash heap of antiquated ideas along with Blockbuster movies and Blackberry phones. A catechism is defined as "a summary of the principles of Christian religion in the form of questions and answers, used for the instruction of Christians." The reality is that all of our children are being catechized every day. At home, in the classroom, on the playground, at summer camp, and at youth group, our children are being trained to think and believe fundamental ideas about the essential questions of human existence: Why are you here? Who are you? What is love? What is good? What is just? Who is God? or even Is God? Therefore, it is essential that Christian parents consider how they are catechizing their children in their formative years. We use a catechism at Stonehaven because we believe these words will instill in our children a view of this world that aligns with God&rsquo;s holy word. A common objection to a catechism is that it can become a rote ritual exercised without true conviction. Are you just saying the words or do you truly mean it? Is this not possible with the training of any good habit? Couldn't our children be tempted to say please and thank you without truly meaning it? Even though we know this is a likely result, it certainly does not keep us from constantly reminding our children to say thank you. In the little years, a catechism will often be recited without a full understanding of the deeper implications of the words. The 44th question in our school catechism asks, "What is justification?" The answer is, "It is God regarding sinners as if they had never sinned." What a heart-rending and beautiful truth of the gospel! I'd be surprised if our second graders comprehend the profound meaning of justification every time they say the answer. Even so, we trust that God is working in them little by little to have a greater appreciation of Christian truth as their minds and hearts gain the capacity to understand these beautiful truths.
                </p>
                <p>
                 There are likely many Christian families wondering how they can realistically begin a new family habit when the children are accustomed to a world without catechism training in the home. Here are four principles for how you can begin a healthy family habit with a catechism:
                 <br>
                </p>
                <ul>
                 <li>
                  Start small
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  Make it consistent
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  Make it joyful
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  Make it special
                 </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                </p>
                <p>
                 You'd be surprised at how much can be done in three minutes just before dinner-time. Ask three or four questions from Stonehaven's catechism or another catechism (Westminster Shorter, Heidelberg, The New City) and start with easy questions that your children know. It is possible this will not be an exciting addition to your family routine so you will want to get creative on how you can bring some joy to the exercise. Maybe you take a dinner roll, an apple, or a broccoli and throw it around to your children as they answer the questions. Consider some simple rewards system like ice cream or Nintendo Switch playing time that help motivate participation. Make the habit special by celebrating milestones as they progress through the benchmarks in the catechism. Make a habit of doing it at the same time every day so that it becomes a part of the fabric of your family routine. There are so many different ways this can be done well. Each family will want to continually reassess how they are training their children to take in Christian truth so fully that it becomes not simply a set of abstract propositions but rather a part of their identity as a human being. Ultimately, we are praying that our children can grow up to believe fully the answer to the first question in the Heidelberg Catechism.

                 When I was young, my parents enjoyed watching the classic 80's sitcom Cheers. One of the episodes I found more memorable was when postal worker Cliff Clavin found himself as a contestant on Jeopardy. With categories catered to Clavin's particular interests like "Stamps from Around the World" and "Bar Trivia", he enters the final round with $22,000: a score more than twice that of his closest competitor. Any Jeopardy enthusiast knows that the smart move in this situation is to wager either $0 or some nominal amount to ensure victory. True to his know-it-all nature, Clavin wagers and loses every dollar with the unforgettable answer, "Who are 3 people who've never been in my kitchen?" Even as a young child, I understood the absurdity of his all-in wager. Too often schools will take untested and large gambles in a desperate attempt to find a shortcut to educational success. In his book
                 <i>
                  Great by Choice
                 </i>
                 , Jim Collins seeks to answer an important question for our current times, "Why do some companies thrive in uncertainty, even chaos, and others do not?" In the fourth chapter, Collins discusses his second principle which he calls empirical creativity. Collins illustrates the essence of his point with the analogy of a warship firing test bullets before using its limited supply of gunpowder on a larger cannonball. He says, "A bullet is a low-cost, low-risk, and low-distraction test or experiment. 10Xers use bullets to empirically validate what will actually work. Based on that empirical validation, they then concentrate their resources to fire a cannonball, enabling large returns from concentrated bets." Many schools have gambled big like Cliff Clavin on unproven educational philosophies including sight reading, new math, common core, student-centered classrooms, and excessive forms of digital learning. I am familiar with one school that placed a big bet on technology. Another school placed an inordinate amount of hope in the development of its athletics program. With the pressing need for success, both schools fired "uncalibrated cannonballs" that ultimately missed their mark over time. The challenge before our school right now and in the coming years is to patiently and thoughtfully test our creative ideas providing the necessary validation of its future success.

                 It is common to see athletes perform various rituals as part of their game-day routine. The great third baseman for the Red Sox, Wade Boggs, performed a litany of eccentric rituals in his own preparation. He woke up at the same time each day, ate chicken before each game, fielded exactly 117 ground balls in practice, took batting practice at 5:17, ran sprints at 7:17, and wrote the Hebrew word
                 <i>
                  Chai
                 </i>
                 ("living") in the dirt before each at bat. Were these seemingly frivolous routines the reason he became one of the great hitters of all time? Although they certainly are not the primary reason, could they have been a contributing factor? There is a reasonable argument that rituals can enhance an athlete's confidence, improve their attention, and increase motivation. Research shows that, "Superstitious rituals enhanced people's confidence in their abilities, motivated greater effort ─and improved subsequent performance." A year or two ago, someone shared with me a video of Barry White Jr., a fifth-grade teacher in North Carolina, who created a personalized handshake ritual with each of his students as they entered the classroom. The coordination and interaction between him and his students is impressive. Most agree that this daily routine undoubtedly helps prepare his students to have a positive attitude for learning in his classroom. I believe God has created our souls to yearn for rituals. A ritual is defined as, "a religious or solemn ceremony consisting of a series of actions performed according to a prescribed order." The Bible outlines an abundance of rituals designed to assist his covenant people in their effort to commune with God. This means that teachers must consider what rituals are embedded into the ethos of their classrooms. Similarly, parents ought to be creating rituals for their children that help define what it means to be a member of their family. These rituals can be used to motivate healthy dispositions towards doing household chores and completing homework. They can also be powerful aids in nurturing important spiritual disciplines that we want to see established in our children at a young age.

                 The encouragement to cultivate rituals must be balanced with another thematic element throughout God&rsquo;s word. In Matthew 15:8, Jesus condemns those that hold to the ritual and yet forsake the more important purpose of obedience to God... "This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me." In Psalm 51, God emphasizes that sacrifices without obedience are worthless. God&rsquo;s people will forever be tempted to believe that the ritual is sufficient for righteousness. As the apostle Paul would say, &ldquo;May it never be!&rdquo; And yet, God never condemns the ritual itself but rather the motive of the heart. We might laugh at the image of Pharisees emptying precisely a tenth of their spice jars as they tithe mint, dill, and cumin (Matthew 23). It is important to note that Jesus is not condemning that peculiar practice but rather that the Pharisees are prioritizing this behavior above the "weightier matters of the law." We are to employ rituals in the lives of our children to help cultivate healthy practices of devotion and worship. As we do so, let us articulate clearly and often the purpose of these rituals to our children. It is inevitable that some will confuse the ritual for the purpose but we can see Biblically this is a risk we can not eliminate.
                </p>
                <p>
                 What might some of these rituals look like? When managing chores for our younger children, the movie Mary Poppins comes to mind. Ms. Poppins seeks to teach the children that "an otherwise unpleasant situation can be pleasant when a pleasant aspect is deliberately introduced." Rituals of singing, dancing, and some application of competition can often make chores more bearable for our children. Such rituals will require coordination, planning, and full participation from parents. Several years ago, I read through a book called
                 <i>
                  Raising a Modern-Day Knight
                 </i>
                 by Robert Lewis. One of the premises of the book is that well-orchestrated rites of passage can help celebrate and emphasize the virtues of responsibility and discipline that we want to see developed in our young men. The ceremonies advocated by Lewis would be at the conclusion of critical milestones in the life of a young man. Milestones achieved through hard work and perseverance. Lewis says, "One of the great tragedies of Western culture today is the absence of this type of ceremony... I cannot even begin to describe the impact on a son's soul when a key manhood moment in his life is forever enshrined and memorialized by a ceremony with other men." The beauty of such rituals is that they will not only benefit the spiritual disciplines of our children but will also certainly have a significant impact on our own sanctification.

                 At Stonehaven, we often speak lightheartedly about the confusion and chaos of the middle school years. As educators, we have spent a lot of time around these unique creatures and with wide eyes we think it prudent to warn our younger parents to buckle up and prepare for a wild adventure full of confusion, insecurity, and foolishness. I believe one measure of God's grace is how little we remember of our own bewildering journey through that awkward phase of our own childhood. One affliction during these years is an overconfidence in one's own brilliance. As newspaper columnist Dave Barry says, "When a boy reaches 13 years of age, the Knowledge Fairy comes around and inserts into his brain all the information in the entire universe. From that point on, he no longer needs any parental guidance. All he needs is parental money." When we banter about these years in a playful manner, the takeaway is not that there is little parenting we can do to fight these inevitable challenges. As a former pastor mine said in a sermon, "Parenting little ones takes much grace. Raising teenagers requires a different kind of grace. And God provides grace like manna." The warning is simply a heads up that confusion is likely around the corner and you'd be wise to put both hands on the steering wheel and plan now for how you should react. What are we to do? Proverbs 22:15 provides the answer, "Folly is bound up in the heart of a child, but the rod of discipline drives it far from him." Foolishness is rampant during these years and the answer is not to ease up on the pedal of discipline. However, how we discipline our older children should naturally change with their age. When my daughter was three years old, I did not sit her down to discuss at length the logic of her sin. As our children grow older, we will rely upon deep conversations impressing upon their hearts the sinful nature of their actions and behaviors. Conversations that are full of honest truths, hard-to-hear truths, designed to challenge our children towards greater virtue.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Certainly punishments ought to continue but that alone is not enough to nurture virtuous behavior in our children. Punishments alone will rarely be sufficient to provide the desired repentance in our children. Hebrews 12:11 reminds us that, "For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it." Discipline is painful for our children and if we desire success, we must be immersing our children in a family community defined by love. We will need to make some significant "discipline" withdrawals with our children and we should be filling up their emotional account with love and grace at every possible opportunity. Daughters during these years need special, devoted time from their fathers. A monthly date night is one of the many ideas that can help our young women feel loved and secure. Mothers would be wise to include their daughters in activities and events directed towards women. The bonds made during such activities are the necessary down payments for future discipline. I would wager that the most important word for how our sons should feel during these years is respect. They are yearning to be listened to, understood, and valued as they wrestle with the great questions of life. Our sons and daughters should be given meaningful opportunities for leadership and decision-making in family affairs. These actions create thick relationships with our children that help foster productive discipline when it is necessary.
                </p>
                <p>
                 What can we be doing during the little years to prepare our children for these years? Two thoughts. First, it is crucial that we are developing self-control in our children when they are young so that this habit is well trained for the young adult years when temptations will certainly abound. A child that has been given everything when they are young will naturally have little defense for the greater sins of adulthood. Proverbs 25:28 says, "A man without self-control is like a city broken into and left without walls." Second, we should be showing our children an abundance of affection. Our children need both physical affection and emotional affection that communicates clearly our love for them. Hugs should be distributed liberally and meaningfully. This affection is crucial in building up a foundation of trust that you will need to lean on as they grow into their young adult years.

                 What if I invited you to enjoy your Friday evening at a local pub deliberating the cardinal virtues with a friend of mine named C.S. Lewis? Or maybe a Saturday afternoon meal at the Busy Bee Cafe discussing human dignity with another friend named Martin Luther King Jr.? How about tea time at Serenbe Farms debating the complexity of human relationships with Jane Austen? It might be difficult to explain the many distinctive aspects of a classical Christian education. However, I have found our appreciation for the value of Great Books to be one of the easiest. Even though the unique opportunity of meeting physically with these great thinkers can only be imagined, we truly have a blessed opportunity of engaging in a conversation with them when we read their classic works. Author Mark Haddon says, &ldquo;Reading is a conversation. All books talk. But a good book listens as well.&rdquo; The more I read, the more convinced I am that the words on the page and the ideas they promote are embedding themselves into the DNA of my soul. We often hear, "you are what you eat." The classical Christian philosophy of books argues that, "you are what you read." To use a whimsical expression from Tolkien, what we read forms "the leaf-mould of the mind." If you desire to grow in truth, goodness, and beauty, then you ought to start spending more time with those writers that best articulate these virtues. One of my favorite Narnian quips is from
                 <i>
                  The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
                 </i>
                 when Lewis says, "Most of us know what we should expect to find in a dragon's lair, but, as I said before, Eustace had read only the wrong books. They had a lot to say about exports and imports and governments and drains, but they were weak on dragons." Where do our children learn what it looks like to be brave, courageous, and sacrificial? Probably not by reading a pedantic treatise from Vandelay Industries on the economic impact of exporting and importing. The cultivation of virtue happens when we immerse our children's imagination into a world like Middle Earth and allow Tolkien&rsquo;s words to paint a surreal picture of courage through the perilous journey of Frodo and Sam. The best way to encourage this in our children is to join them on their literary journeys by reading great literature as well.

                 In the 1972 Munich Olympics, 800-meter runner Dave Wottle found himself in last place after the first lap of the two-lap race. If anyone were to pause the race at the halfway point and ask their friend, "Who wins this race?", you could only guess correctly knowing it was a trick question. With a jaw-dropping final lap, Wottle would pass all runners in front of him to win the gold medal. He would clock virtually even 200-meter split times of 26 seconds: in other words, his race was an impressive example of consistency and discipline. As I continue through Jim Collins book
                 <i>
                  Great by Choice
                 </i>
                 , the third chapter unpacks the idea of fanatic discipline: the first of a triad of core behaviors exhibited by organizations that thrive during seasons of chaos and uncertainty. Collins defines discipline as "consistency of action-consistency with values, consistency with long-term goals, consistency with performance standards, consistency of method, consistency over time." Wottle was placed in a position of uncertainty and fear on the first lap when he was well behind all the other runners in the race. He would later say, "There was a little bit of terror in the beginning because I found myself so far behind. I was eight to ten meters behind and I felt, I'm just out of it." Yet, he demonstrates a remarkable discipline in holding back. The organizations Collins studies in his book show a similar restraint and discipline. In 1996, with business booming, Southwest Airlines had more than 100 cities clamoring for Southwest to expand their service to their cities. They ended up opening up service in only four cities that year. Collins says, "Southwest had the discipline to hold back in good times so as not to extend beyond its ability to preserve profitability and the Southwest culture." Our school has been blessed over the past several years with a season of 'good times.' What a blessing to have more children and families enjoy the truth, goodness, and beauty of a Stonehaven education. At the same time, we are committed to a fanatic discipline that will be cautious of allowing our school to grow

                 fast. It is easy to think of all the things our school might be able to do if we were bigger. It is more challenging and probably more important for us to consider what we might lose if we were to grow too fast.

                 Theologian N.T. Wright says, "Character is a slowly forming thing. You can no more force character on someone than you can force a tree to produce fruit when it isn't ready to do so. The person has to choose, again and again, to develop the moral muscles and skills which will shape and form the fully flourishing character." I have found it tempting to believe virtue could be developed purely by knowledge and understanding. If I could just get my hands on the right book, listen to an insightful sermon series, or find the right Christian mentor. Could I not make some giant virtue leap forward? Even though I have found each of these activities valuable, they are merely pieces of a much more complex puzzle for the flourishing of our souls. As Wright argues above, virtue is a slowly forming thing requiring the never-ceasing development of our moral muscles. The most decorated marathon runner of all-time, Eliud Kipchoge, runs more than 120 miles each week. Every twenty mile workout likely has an almost imperceptible impact on Kipchoge's overall fitness. And yet, over time, every mile contributes to his becoming the greatest marathon runner of the modern era. Kipchoge says, "Only the disciplined ones in life are free." It is estimated that elite golfers often hit more than 1,000 balls in a single day. Michael Jordan attempted 24,537 shots in his career (he missed more than he made) and this does not include shots attempted in practice. Does it not make sense that the formation of our character would require the same fanatical discipline and commitment? As we train up our children, we aim to instill in them an understanding that the development of their character will take hard work, consistent training, and perseverance over time. The pursuit of Godly character begins every morning when our children wake up and continues every moment of the day. We are provided the awesome privilege as their parents and teachers to help train their moral muscles to appreciate and love goodness.

                 In Psalm 146:3 we are commanded to, "Put not your trust in princes, in a son of man, in whom there is no salvation." This past weekend I saw a billboard that boldly proclaimed that, "Only God and Donald Trump can save this country." The name of the candidate is irrelevant: it could've been Joe Biden, Nelson Mandela, or Abraham Lincoln. This billboard expresses a view of politics rampant on both sides of the political aisle: a misplaced hope and trust in the saving power of politics. A result of the hope of the gospel is that the salvation of our world is not dependent on sinful man. How does Stonehaven plan on training our children to navigate the complex and divisive world of politics? First, we want to teach our children to place their ultimate hope and joy in the Lord (Psalm 37:4-6, Nehemiah 8:10). We need look no further than many examples from the 20th century to find the failure of depending upon the government for salvation. Second, we aim to teach our children to understand that politics, with all its faults, is a good and necessary thing. As Winston Churchill quipped, "Democracy is the worst form of government except for all the others." God uses politics and politicians for his good purpose. In Proverbs 21:1 we are assured that, "The king's heart is a stream of water in the hand of the Lord; he turns it wherever he will." Third, we aim to train our children how to faithfully apply God's word to politics, including how they vote. It is inevitable that certain candidates will govern in a more God-honoring way than other candidates. The policies, ideas, and views promoted are not all created equal. Some are good, others are bad, and others are just plain evil. It is our job as parents and teachers to engage in the conversation and debate that will help our children faithfully discern good and evil amidst the chaos of our current political climate.

                 The year was 1923, and British runner Eric Liddell found himself pushed to the ground just after the start of a 440-yard race. Liddell, whose story was made popular by the movie
                 <i>
                  Chariots of Fire
                 </i>
                 , hesitated for a moment thinking he was disqualified. Encouraged by his coach to continue, Liddell began what observers might have considered a foolhardy effort to catch the other runners who were now 20 yards down the track. With his head back and arms flailing wildly, he passed the leader of the race a few yards before the finish line to complete a truly remarkable comeback. He would be unconscious from exhaustion for the next thirty minutes. Liddell was known for having terrible running form, one observer would say he resembled "a stricken stag."  Even with his poor running form, Liddell possessed a relentless will to win. One appropriate adjective defining how Liddell ran, and also how he lived his life, was scrappy. Scrappy is defined as "having a strong, determined character, and willing to argue or fight for what you want." A few months ago, a teacher at Stonehaven said, "You know what I love about Stonehaven? We're scrappy." I was impacted by the word choice both because it is not a word often used to define a school and secondly it was a refreshing compliment regarding the shared ethos of our school community. As we go into the coming months and years, I want to leverage the scrappiness of our school community in a strategic way. One of the Stonehaven shout outs reminds us that, "Many hands... make light work!" For years our school has dreamed of things we could do in our own building and property. In the coming month, we will be moving into the Upper School campus and ushering in a new season of opportunities for our school. Utilizing the scrappiness of our community, what kind of beautiful, creative, and amazing things can our 'many hands' create for our children? For all those Stonehaven DIYers out there, please read the DIO Committee blurb below to see how you can join us in the design, planning, and creation of amazing things for our school.
