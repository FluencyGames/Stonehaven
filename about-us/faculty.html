                                      Laura Keesee earned a B.S. in Psychology from King College in Bristol, Tennessee, a Master of Education in Community Counseling from Georgia State University, and a Certificate of Completion from Psychological Studies Institute (now Richmont Graduate University) in Atlanta. In 2019, she received training in the Orton-Gillingham approach, participating in workshops through The Dyslexia Resource, which works in partnership with The Schenck School. This training enriched her knowledge of language and strengthened her passion and ability to teach phonics and reading. Thanks to Laura, many Stonehaven staff as well as students now enjoy counting syllables using &ldquo;whale talk&rdquo; and finding the accented syllable by &ldquo;calling the dog&rdquo;. Laura is excited to begin her 23rd year teaching Kindergarten, 16 of which have been at Stonehaven, where she is thankful for the privilege of partnering with parents in the education, nurture, and godly training of their children. In addition to teaching at Stonehaven, Laura has enjoyed opportunities to teach English and lead Bible studies in Japan, India, and Albania. She and her husband Scott have been married for 34 years and are the parents of three adult children. Scott and Laura are active members at Midway Presbyterian Church (PCA). When not teaching or spending time with her family, she enjoys knitting, crocheting, and reading historical fiction, mysteries, and the works of great theologians.

                                      Erin Denny graduated from College of Charleston with a BS in Business Administration and Marketing.  She has spent the last 18 years investing in her family&rsquo;s small business with her husband, Mike. However, her greatest passion has been raising her family, which led her to classically homeschool their three children for 7 years. While homeschooling, she taught on weekly community days at Classical Conversations Smyrna until God led her family to Stonehaven. Stonehaven has been the greatest gift to her family the past three years. She joined the Stonehaven staff part-time in 2020-2021 as the Blended Learning Specialist and is incredibly humbled to teach second grade this year.  She is most excited to partner with parents to instill in her students a deep joy of learning, disciple their hearts towards the Lord, and encourage their God-given gifts so they will grow to make God known in the world.  Some of her favorite things are date nights with her husband, hiking with her family, cooking, and reading good stories with her children, preferably with a cup of hot tea.

                                      An aspiring cat lady, Maggie Bowling graduated from Radford University with a degree in history. When she was invited to teach missionary kids in Russia for a season, law school plans were derailed, and the experience cemented her love for education. She decided to classically homeschool her own children for nine years, teaching at the Master&rsquo;s Academy in Marietta and contributing to the community there. Outside of classical education, Maggie has also spent three years supporting special needs students in the public school system and is devoted to that community. She has traveled twice with her family to Honduras to share God&rsquo;s care for orphans and would love to go back with her husband Alan and their four teenage-to-adult kids. Her family attends Highlands Church in Marietta, where she serves as the children&rsquo;s pastor. Maggie also loves to read, run, travel, and do crossword puzzles.

                                      Born and raised in sunny Southern California, James Mastrianna recently moved to Marietta from Santa Cruz, California. He has been blessed with a beautiful wife of ten years, and they have four wild and sweet children. He has spent fifteen years in education roles and ministerial positions as Youth Pastor and Intern program director in the local church. Throughout his tenure, he's had the privilege of educating, discipling, and caring for many families and students. He is a student in the Masters' program at Westminster Theological Seminary (East) and a life-long learner at heart and particularly interested in Historical studies, Theology, American church history, Philosophy and ALL things Sports, especially the Dodgers. His Classical Education philosophy stems from a focus on discipleship pertaining to dealing with the issues of the heart. His goal is that discipleship is more than modified behavior and through instruction, discipline, and admonishment, he aims to cultivate virtue and godliness amidst difficult issues.

                                      Chris Blackman was born in California and grew up in Las Vegas NV but spent his formative years in the Chattanooga TN area. After high school he attended Kennesaw State University where he earned a B.A. in History with a minor in International Affairs. During his time in college Jesus got a hold of Chris's life and he began to feel the Lord calling him towards vocational ministry. He attended Reformed Theological Seminary where he graduated with a masters of divinity degree. While attending RTS Chris was hired by Stonehaven to work as their facilities manager and after school teacher. He also spent the last four years working as an ESL teacher to adult immigrants for a non-profit in Atlanta and serving as a pastoral intern at his church. Chris, his wife Kelsey, and daughter Genesis love hiking along the Chattahoochee river, exploring the rich diversity of food on Buford highway, and entertaining people in their home. The most sanctifying part of Chris's day is the short period of time in the morning before he can greedily guzzle his first cup of pure, unadulterated by sin, black cup of coffee. Its all down hill from there...

                                      A native Texan, Susan grew up as the daughter of a high school and college math teacher.  She grew up wondering why anyone of sound mind would want to teach math as a profession?! After graduating from Texas A&amp;M University (Whoop!) with a degree in Finance, she began a career in commercial banking.  Following a few years as a stay-at-home-mom, she returned to the working world at a crisis pregnancy center as bookkeeper, parenting teacher and school speaker. Shortly after enrolling their girls in a Classical Christian school outside of Fort Worth, TX, Susan was asked to prayerfully consider teaching mid-level math. Within a few weeks, she completely understood the desire to teach and is now passionate about the Classical Christian school model.  It is a joy to share that math is not a neutral subject, and it all "works" because of our loving Creator.  Susan has been married to her husband, Clay, for 19 years and they have three daughters that attend Stonehaven.  They are members of The Church of the Apostles.  She enjoys exercise, reading when she can, and taking walks with her family and crazy dog, Amos.

After earning his Bachelors in Middle Grade Education with a focus in science and English from Kennesaw State University, he went back for his Master's in English Education.  Within his first two years of teaching he also became gifted certified through the Fulton county school system.  He loves being in the classroom for many reasons, but his favorite are developing relationships with his students and helping them continue their love of learning.  Mr. Cown loves to be outside traveling to new places, hiking in the wilderness, or just being in nature with his wife and two kids, Judah (8) and Josie (6).  You also have likely seen him riding bikes to and from Stonehaven with his family.   When he needs to feel productive, he loves to spend time on building projects around the house, playing guitar and drums, and cooking for family and friends.  Additionally, you may find him discussing literature and thematic events with whomever will give him the opportunity.

                                      After getting bit by the language bug in high school, Matt studied 5 languages en route to a B.A. in Linguistics from the University of Georgia and an M.A. in Applied Linguistics from Biola University, with plans to translate the Bible with Wycliffe. When those plans changed, he stumbled into an 11-year career in real estate finance. During that time, Matt never lost his love of languages or his desire to help others grow in wisdom, knowledge and discipleship with Jesus. He is thrilled for the opportunity to put those to work as a teacher at Stonehaven. Matt and his wife Ashleigh live in Smyrna with their sons Burke (8) and Josiah (6), and enjoy serving at The Square Church. On weekends the Stovers can often be found looking for wildlife on a local trail or having their hearts broken by the Georgia Bulldogs. A few of Matt&rsquo;s favorite things are good books, donuts, coffee, and playing just about any sport.

                                      Natalia Hicks came from Russia, where she graduated from St. Petersburg (formerly Leningrad) State University with a Master's Degree in History and Bachelor's in Education. For many years, Natalia worked in museums across St. Petersburg as a tour guide and curator. While working at the Hermitage, she met her husband, John, and moved to America. For 17 years, Natalia worked as an art teacher at Whitefield Academy, a private Christian school in Smyrna, GA. Her first goal is for students to recognize the beauty of this marvelous universe. God worked as the first artist when He was creating it. Her second goal is to discover and cherish the gift of creativity in everyone, for people are made in His image. Having recently retired, she missed the opportunity to interact with students and is very excited to be a part of Stonehaven School. In her free time, Natalia paints with oils in her studio, hikes with her daughter, Rachel, and her Bernese Mountain Dog, Max, and can't wait to start traveling again with her husband John.
